<h1>Hello welcome</h1></u>
<p><h5>A paragraph is a unit of writing focused on a single idea, consisting of one or more
 sentences that are typically organized around a topic sentence. <b>Paragraphs<b> are usually marked by an 
indentation of the first <i> line or a skipped line</i>, signaling a new section to the reader and helping
 to structure a longer piece of writing by organizing thoughts and topics.
